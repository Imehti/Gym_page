        Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most
        important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise
        helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long
        term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia,
        depression, and many cancers.

          <p>
            Exercise improves brain health and learning. It can help people
            sleep better. When you exercise, your body makes chemicals that help
            you feel good. Exercise lowers your chances of depression and
            decreases feelings of anxiety. Plus, exercise can give you a real
            sense of accomplishment and pride at having achieved a goal â€” like
            mastering a new dance routine or beating an old time in the
            100-meter dash.

        <p>
          The heart isn't the only muscle to benefit from regular exercise.
          The other muscles in your body enjoy exercise too. When you use your
          muscles, they become stronger. Strong muscles are also a plus
          because they support your joints and help prevent injuries.
          Muscle-strengthening activities can also be bone-strengthening.

            One of the biggest reasons people drop an exercise program is lack
            of interest: If what you're doing isn't fun, it's hard to keep it
            up. But there are many different sports and activities to try to see
            which one inspires you. If you need a little more motivation, take a
            class, join a team, or find an exercise buddy to help keep you on
            track. Talk to someone, like a coach or fitness expert at a gym, who
            can help you get started on a program that's right for you and your
            level of fitness.
